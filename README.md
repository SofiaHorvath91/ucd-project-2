### 3. Scope

* I wanted clear and informative content.
* I wanted a visually appealing and creative design.
* I wanted interesting and challenging games and quizes.
* I wanted smooth and interactive playing experience.
* I wanted detailed feedback to users about their results.
### 4. Structure

* The content is easy to read and playing experience is smooth with self-explanatory steps.
* The Index page displays clearly the site’s main subject, allows to explore site content, and appeal visitors to stay and try Sorting Quiz.
* The Sorting Quiz page allows users to answer questions related to their personality to dicover their main house(s) at the end, along with their results for other great houses too.

### 5. Skeleton
The very basic skeleton of the site was modelled by Wireframes via Balsamiq, and during site development, additional design elements was added for better UX.

* [Sorting Quiz Page Wireframe](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd-project-2/blob/main/img/readme/balsamiq-sorting-quiz.png)

* [Hangman Game Page Wireframe](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd-project-2/blob/main/img/readme/balsamiq-hangman.png)
* [Memory Game Page Wireframe](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd-project-2/blob/main/img/readme/balsamiq-memorygame.png)
### 6. Style
* Design & Colours
  * When planning the project, to not distract users' attention from games and quizes, yet to provide appealing design, I went along with a minimalist design with simple yet expressing visual backup. For the color theme, I wanted a color pair with high contrast to emphasize action buttons and highlights, so I chose the dark/light grey - bright gold (#ffc107) pair which also suits well the royal theme.
* Font Selection
  * The main font type was chosen with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and is used across the whole of the website: [IM Fell French Canon SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IM+Fell+French+Canon+SC). This is a small cap, elegant font type which strongly ressembles to official GoT font type - I tested the free version of GoT type as well, but it does not handle special characters so I decided to use a very similar type.
## Features
### 1. Existing Features
* __Navigation Bar__
  * Featured on all pages, the navigation bar includes links to all subpages and is identical on each page for smooth navigation.

## Code validation

### 1. Automated tests
* HTML\
Passing the HTML of all pages through the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and no errors have been found, only 1 warning (empty header2 element used for storing wrong user letters in hangman game, so it is intended to be empty and later filled by user input through Javascript).
  * [Index Page Validation](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd-project-2/blob/main/img/readme/w3validator-html-index.pdf)
  * [Sorting Quiz Page Validation](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd-project-2/blob/main/img/readme/w3validator-html-sorting.pdf)
  * [Quizes Page Validation](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd-project-2/blob/main/img/readme/w3validator-html-quiz.pdf)
  * [Hangman Game Page Validation](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd-project-2/blob/main/img/readme/w3validator-html-hangman.pdf)
  * [Memory Game Page Validation](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd-project-2/blob/main/img/readme/w3validator-html-memorygame.pdf)
* CSS\
Passing the CSS of all pages through the [W3C Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and no errors have been found.\
Warnings are coming from dynamic CSS variables and imported style sheets which are out of scope of validator. Also warning appears concerning -webkit/-moz effects, as these elements are out of scope for validator.

### 2. Manual tests
* Desktop\
Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge: pages are working fine and have the corresponding style.
* Mobile\
Tested with Samsung A5, Galaxy Fold, iPhone 5, and iPad, and webpage works well, responsive as intended and no style deformations.
* Mozilla Developer Tools\
Tested for available devices, webpage works well, responsive as intended, no style deformations and no error messages for Javascript.
  
### 3. Accessibility tests
The entire website was verified about accessibility using [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/). Only few stylistic errors found (low contrast errors for games & quizes cards on Index page and one error hown for empty header2 element used for storing wrong user letters in hangman game which is intended to be empty and later filled by user input through Javascript), alerts related mostly to heading elements hierarchy.

### 4. Bugs and Solution
After building the Hangman game page, I realized that for mobile use, a workaround should be used as key-down/key-press event handling does not work mobile devices. Therefore a text input was included additionally to prompt mobile keyboard to appear and allow users to enter their letter input.
